Audit date: 2026-07-22 · Baseline `9025aa3` (master) · Engine `backend/main.py` (5831 L),
`backend/reactor.py`, `backend/controllers.py`, `backend/steam_system.py`.
STRICT source: `References/Combined_1750_MTPD_100% load_PFD TablesProcess_Data.md` (CLAUDE.md §0).

For every equipment tag the four mandated questions are answered:

|---|----------|
| Q1 | Are the bound equations bound **correctly**? |
| Q2 | Is the **solver engine** (Sequential-Modular vs Equation-Oriented) the right one? |
| Q3 | Is **hybrid-modelling variability** required? |
| Q4 | Are there modelling equations **missing** that should be added and working? |

Equation categories audited per tag:
**C1** Total mass balance · **C2** Component species balance · **C3** Energy balance (enthalpy) ·
**C4** Isenthalpic / isothermal flash · **C5** EoS & activity models · **C6** Summation equations ·
**C7** Kinetics & reaction · **C8** Transport phenomena · **C9** Hydraulic & equipment-specific ·
**C10** Constitutive & physical property · **C11** Control & instrumentation (dynamic).

### Q2 — Solver engine: Sequential-Modular is **CORRECT** and should stay

The engine is a strict **Sequential-Modular (SM)** flowsheet: each equipment tag is a Python
function evaluated once per tick, in physical flow order, inside `step_sim(dt)`
(`backend/main.py:3098`). Every recycle / algebraic loop is **torn with a prior-step lagged
value** — `s.tlag[...]`, `recyc_prev`, `m718B_prev`, `s.p_syn_bara`, the shadow holdups — so no
simultaneous system is ever assembled and no Newton–Raphson solve exists anywhere.

This is the right choice, and Equation-Oriented (EO) would be the wrong one here:

* The deliverable is a **real-time Operator Training Simulator**. SM gives a bounded, constant
  cost per tick with no convergence failure mode. An EO solve can fail to converge mid-transient
  and would stall the HMI — unacceptable for an OTS.
* The tear variables are **physically real dynamic states** (vessel holdups, thermal inertia,
  header pressures), not numerical artefacts. Integrating them explicitly is the physics, not a
  shortcut. dt is small relative to every process time constant (τ ≈ 6–45 min vs dt ≤ 0.25 s
  after the `STEP_CAP` fix), so the one-tick tear lag is far below instrument resolution.
* The design-anchor requirement (bit-exact reproduction of the 100 % HMB) is satisfiable in SM
  by construction — every module is calibrated so its residual is exactly zero at the seed. An EO
  formulation would reintroduce solver tolerance into a contract that demands `diffs 0`.

**Verdict: SM confirmed for all 57 tags. No tag requires EO.** The only defensible EO candidate
would be the HP synthesis loop (322E001/E002/R001/E003/F001), whose recycle is stiff — but the
`_disturbance_gate` + boot-pin mechanism already delivers the fixed point EO would compute, at
zero convergence risk.

### Q3 — Hybrid-modelling variability: **REQUIRED, and already present** — but unevenly

The engine is already a hybrid: first-principles conservation laws wrapped around calibrated
empirical layers. That is correct for a urea plant, where the NH₃–CO₂–H₂O–urea system has no
tractable closed-form VLE.

Empirical / data-driven layers currently in place:

| Layer | Where | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| HPCC component split φᵢ | `HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` → `_hpcc_flash_split` (main.py:1553 / 1971) | design HMB; now the **anchor** of a live (T,P) flash |
| Stripper split fᵢ + η modifiers | `STRIP_FRAC_DES`, `g_T/g_NC/g_HC` (main.py:1453) | design HMB |
| Reactor θᵢ vapour/liquid split | `REACT_THETA_OG` (main.py:1571) | design HMB |
| Scrubber pinned discharges | `SCRUB_*_KMOLH_DES` (main.py:2140) | design HMB |
| Modified Inoue–Kanai conversion | `reactor.inoue_kanai_X` | re-fitted to plant HMB |
| Back-solved latents λ / UA | 323/324/328 blocks | design fixed point |
| Ejector negative equal-% spindle law | `EJ_SPINDLE_R` (main.py:1152) | 322F001 datasheet |
| Soft sensors (`conc_infer_324`, `ppm_infer_328701`) | main.py:66 / 136 | PFD guarantees |

**Where hybrid variability was missing** is the substance of findings **F-1..F-6** below: the
empirical split fractions were *frozen at their design values* and carried **no state dependence**.
A split fraction is only a valid hybrid layer if it is a *function* — φᵢ(T, P, composition). As
originally coded, φᵢ was a constant, so the units they describe could not respond to the very
disturbances an OTS exists to train on. Both remediation slots in §5 close exactly this class: the
323/324 vaporisers now bind φ to the live duty, and 322E002 binds φᵢ to a live (T,P) flash. The
constants are not discarded — each becomes the *anchor* of the function, evaluating to itself at the
design seed, which is what keeps the HMB bit-exact.

## 1. Findings register

Severity: **A** = wrong physics an operator can trigger from the HMI · **B** = missing equation
that limits training fidelity · **C** = cosmetic / documentation.

| ID | Sev | Unit | Category | Finding |
|----|-----|------|----------|---------|
| **F-1** | A | 323F004 | C4 Isenthalpic flash | Adiabatic-flash vapour is a **frozen split fraction** `m_701 = φ·m_314`, not an enthalpy balance. Feed temperature from Stage 1 can move ±30 °C and the flash produces identical vapour. **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-2** | A | 323C003 / 323E002 | C1↔C3 | Boil-up `m_305 = φ·m_feed` is **independent of the live heater duty** `Q_e002_kw`. Shutting PV-329202 gives zero duty yet full design overhead vapour; the energy deficit is dumped into the temperature ODE. **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-3** | A | 323F010 / 323E010 | C1↔C3 | Identical defect: `m_evap = φ·m_319` ignores `Q_e010_kw`. **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-4** | A | 324E001 / 324F001 | C1↔C3, C10 | `p1_m = urea1_in / R324_W_EV1` pins the Stage-1 melt at **94.31 % hard**. Water removed is fixed by a constant, not by `Q_e001_kw`. Cutting Evap-I steam cannot dilute the product. **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-5** | A | 324E003 / 324F003 | C1↔C3, C10 | Identical defect at Stage 2 (`R324_W_EV2` = 97.71 % hard). **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-6** | B | 322E002 | C5 EoS/activity | HPCC condensation split `φᵢ = HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` is **invariant to shell temperature and loop pressure**. Raising LP-steam pressure changes duty and `T_prod` (via NTU) but not one mole of condensate. **CLOSED** — see §5. |
| **F-7** | B | 328C003 | C7 Kinetics | The hydrolyser carries **no reaction extent at all** — urea hydrolysis is lumped into the back-solved `R328_C003_LAM748`. Arrhenius hydrolysis kinetics exist only in the read-only `ppm_infer_328701` soft sensor, not in the mass balance. |
| **F-8** | B | 323/324/328/329 | C2 Component balance | Species tracking (`MW_COMP`, 9 components) exists **only in unit 322**. Everything downstream of LV-322501 is lumped-mass. No component balance, hence no C6 summation equations, downstream. |
| **F-9** | C | tooling | — | `scratchpad/regress.py` `os.chdir(BACKEND)` before writing `argv[1]`, so the relative gate command in CLAUDE.md §7 / handoff.md fails with `FileNotFoundError`. Gate must be invoked with an **absolute** output path. **CLOSED** — `regress.py` now resolves `argv[1]` before the chdir (TD-010). |
| **F-10** | A | 323E002, 323E010, 324E001, 324E003 | C3, C8 | **Condensing-steam heater duty is unbounded below.** `Q = UA·(Tsat(p_chest) − T)` with `p_chest` clamped to 0.02 bar a (Tsat ≈ 17.5 °C) makes a shut steam valve a *refrigerator*: probe measured the Evap-I melt driven to **22 °C** and the 323C003 column to **13.6 °C**. A condensing chest cannot remove heat — it simply stops condensing. Found by disturbance-probing the F-2..F-5 fixes; the defect pre-dates them but was masked while the boil-up ignored the duty. **CLOSED** — see §5. |

Findings previously documented but **already closed in code** (audit re-verified — do not re-report):

* 328E021 hot side is **no longer static**. `T_749` is a live energy-balance closure bounded by
  the two inlet temperatures (`main.py:3960`), using `R328_E021_LOSS_DT`. The As-Built reference
  section describing this as an open gap is stale.

### Control & instrumentation (C11) — plant-wide

`_ctrl_ipd` (main.py:1215) is a velocity-form **I-PD**: P on PV (no setpoint derivative kick),
I on error with optional deadzone `Dz`, D on PV with optional first-order filter `Tf`, negative-Td
sentinel decode, bumpless CAS setpoint transfer, and structural anti-windup (the velocity form
clamps `op`, so no integral state can wind). Instrument dynamics are available as `_lag1`,
`_delay` (transport), `_foptd`. Bad-PV handling freezes at last-good.

**Verdict: C11 is complete and correct across all loops. No finding.**

## 5. Applied fixes

### Units 323 + 324 — energy/mass re-coupling (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, F-10)

All bit-exact at the design seed by construction: each duty ratio `q_avail / Q_DES` is written in
the **same float operand order** as its design constant, so it evaluates to exactly `1.0`, and
every `min()` / `max()` guard is non-binding at design.

| Tag | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| 323C003 / 323E002 | `m_305 = φ·m_feed` | `m_305 = min(φ·m_feed, M305_DES·q_avail/Q305_DES)` — boil-up energy-limited |
| 323F004 | `m_701 = φ·m_314` | true isenthalpic flash: `T_flash = 106 + [Tsat(P) − Tsat(1.13)]` (saturation constraint) and `m_701·λ = m_314·cp·ΔT − M·cp·(T_sat−T)/τ`. Substituting into the energy ODE yields exactly `dT/dt = (T_sat − T)/τ`, so energy stays conserved |
| 323F010 / 323E010 | `m_evap = φ·m_319` | `min(φ·m_319, MEVAP_DES·q_avail/QEVAP_DES)` |
| 324E001 | `p1_m = urea_in / 0.9431` (strength pinned) | `v1 = min(v_conc, V1_DES·q_avail/Q1_DES)`; `w1_live` published to `urea_pct` and `PY-324201` |
| 324E003 | `p2_gen = urea_in / 0.9771` (strength pinned) | same shape; `w2_live` published to `urea_pct` and `AY-324701`; Stage-2 feed enthalpy now uses the **live** Stage-1 outlet temperature, and the recycle carries its live strength through `s.tlag["R324_recyc_w"]` |
| all four steam chests | `Q = UA·(Tsat − T)` | `Q = max(UA·(Tsat − T), 0)` (F-10) |
| `conc_infer_324` | `w_des` assumed a constant in (0,1) | reference mole fraction clamped to the same physical band as the live one — `w_des` is now a live argument that legally reaches 0 on cold start |

**Verification** (`scratchpad/probe_323_324.py`):

* *Design fixed point, 480 s* — 94.3 % / 97.7 % / 106.0 °C / 24.56 / 4.43 / 8.74 t/h, **zero drift**.
* *Evap-I steam cut* — `Q → 0`, evaporation → 0, product falls **94.3 % → 80.0 %** (pass-through),
  melt coasts 130 → 100 °C asymptoting to its 99 °C feed. Previously the product strength could
  not move at all and the melt crashed to 22 °C.
* *323E002 steam cut* — `Q → 0`, overhead 305 collapses to 0, column decays 121 → 105 °C, and the
  downstream flash correctly produces **less** vapour (4.43 → 3.10 t/h) on its now-colder feed.

Gates: pin `leaves 25 / keys 15 / diffs 0` · suite `110 passed`.

### Unit 322 — 322E002 HPCC live (T,P) phase split (F-6)

The calibrated vector `HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` was measured at one point (170 °C, 144.2 bar a) and then
frozen, so the condenser was thermodynamically **inert**. The fix does not discard the calibration —
it anchors a real flash on it.

**1. Back-solve the design K-values from the calibration, every tick, against the live feed.**
Over the distributing set `D = {k : 0 < φ_des,k < 1} = {CO₂, NH₃, H₂O, N₂}`:

$$\psi_{des}=\sum_{k\in D} z_k\,\varphi_{des,k},\qquad
K_{des,k}=\frac{\varphi_{des,k}\,(1-\psi_{des})}{\psi_{des}\,(1-\varphi_{des,k})}$$

This keeps the melt's measured activity coefficients baked into the K-values; only the *deviation*
from the calibration point is model-driven.

**2. Correct K to the live (T, P).** The NH₃/CO₂ "condensation" is not physical condensation — it is
the carbamate equilibrium NH₂COONH₄(l) ⇌ 2 NH₃(g) + CO₂(g), $K_p = p_{NH_3}^2\,p_{CO_2}$, with
ΔH_dis ≈ 160 kJ/mol — which is already in the code as `HPCC_DH_CARB_KJMOL`. Because K_p is a
**third-order** product, the measured temperature coefficient of the dissociation *pressure* is one
third of the reaction enthalpy (≈ 12.8 kcal/mol = 53.3 kJ/mol — Bennett 1953, Ramachandran 1998).
With y_NH₃ ≈ 2 y_CO₂ this gives y_i ∝ K_p(T)^{1/3}/P, so

$$K_k(T,P)=K_{des,k}\;\exp\!\left[\frac{\Delta H_k}{R}\!\left(\frac{1}{T_{des}}-\frac{1}{T}\right)\right]\frac{P_{des}}{P}$$

with ΔH = ΔH_carb/3 for CO₂ and NH₃, ΔH = 36 900 J/mol (water latent at 170 °C) for H₂O by Raoult,
and ΔH = 0 for N₂ (permanent gas, Henry). Species with φ_des exactly 1 (O₂/CH₄/H₂ — never condense)
or exactly 0 (Urea/Biuret — never boil) sit **outside** the flash.

**3. Solve Rachford-Rice by bisection, not Newton.** g(ψ) is strictly decreasing on [0,1], so a
fixed 60-sweep bracket is exact to 2⁻⁶⁰ at bounded cost and **cannot** fail to converge. This is the
same argument that keeps the flowsheet Sequential-Modular (§0 Q2): an OTS tick must never miss its
deadline.

**4. Rate-limit it — the equilibrium flash alone is wrong for this vessel.** The K-values of the
distributing set are tightly clustered, so a common factor moves the whole mixture together: the raw
equilibrium target swings φ_CO₂ from 0.0009 to 1.0 across 150 → 190 °C (probe Phase 0). That is not
how a falling-film condenser behaves. `References/HPCC description.md` §5.2–5.3 is explicit that
322E002 is **interfacial mass-transfer limited** — gas must diffuse to the film, cross the interface
and react. So φ is relaxed toward the equilibrium target over the condenser's own holdup constant
`HPCC_TAU_FILL_MIN` (6 min), making the split a genuine **dynamic state** `s.hpcc_phi`. This is the
audit's *missing equation* for this tag: the condenser had no composition dynamics at all.

**5. Anchoring.** Three independent guarantees, in order: the flash short-circuits to the
calibration when `p_rat == 1.0 and T_K == T_des_K` (so no Rachford-Rice tolerance ever reaches the
module-load or boot-pin passes); `dt = 0` on those passes makes the relaxation coefficient exactly
0; and the result is blended through the Option-1 `_disturbance_gate` exactly as `T_prod` is, so
`gate == 0` ⇒ φ ≡ `HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` bit-exact.

Also fixed in the same tag: `p_bub` was evaluated at the frozen `HPCC_T_PROD_DES_C` — a bubble
pressure taken at a fixed temperature is not a bubble pressure. It now uses the live (gated)
`T_prod`. `P_bub` is telemetry only (PI-322E002); it does **not** enter `pt_target`, so no new loop.

| Tag | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| 322E002 | `φᵢ = HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` (frozen constant) | anchored (T,P) Rachford-Rice flash, film-relaxed over `HPCC_TAU_FILL_MIN`, gate-blended |
| 322E002 | `p_bub = bubble_p(170.0, L, W)` | `p_bub = bubble_p(T_prod, L, W)` |
| 322E002 | no composition state | `s.hpcc_phi` — interfacial split, seeded at the calibration |

**Loop-gain check** (the `_disturbance_gate` self-excitation path, `main.py:1878`). The new coupling
is **negative feedback** in both legs: T↑ → K↑ → φ↑ → less CO₂ absorbed → q_carb↓ → T_adb↓ → T↓; and
P↑ → K↓ → more condensation → duty↑ → LP header↑ → shell↑ → T↑ → K↑ (opposing). Measured, not
assumed — see below.

**Verification** (`scratchpad/probe_322e002_flash.py`):

* *Design hold, 600 s* — gate 0.000000, T_prod drift **0.000e+00 °C**, and φ equals
  `HPCC_FRAC_GAS_DES` **exactly, every component** (identity comparison, not a tolerance).
* *MP supply valve 50 → 62 %* (PIC-329204 to MAN) — shell runs hotter, TT-322010 170.00 → 170.49 °C,
  and the split follows: φ_CO₂ **0.2036 → 0.2342**, φ_NH₃ 0.2977 → 0.3357, gas product
  **60.33 → 69.34 t/h**. Every one of these was *identically zero* before the fix.
* *N/C setpoint cut to 92 %* — φ_CO₂ → 0.2105, level swells 49.7 → 55.3 %, duty 63 122 → 66 706 kW.
* *Self-excitation* — T_prod spans **0.0205 °C** (steam disturbance) and **0.2329 °C** (N/C
  disturbance) over the final five minutes: monotone convergence, no ringing, no runaway.

Gates: pin `leaves 25 / keys 15 / diffs 0` · suite `123 passed`.

### Still open

F-7 (hydrolyser kinetics) and F-8 (downstream component balance) are **not** landed — F-8 is a
cross-unit architectural change that needs its own project, and F-7 depends on it. F-9 is a tooling
note: invoke the gate with an absolute output path (now fixed in `regress.py` itself).
